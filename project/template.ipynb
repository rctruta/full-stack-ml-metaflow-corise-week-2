    "# Week 2 Project: Refining the Art of Sentiment Analysis at ModaMetric\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 2! The ModaMetric team is still buzzing from the achievements of last week. You've shown them the power of Metaflow and the potential of machine learning. However, there's more to explore, more to refine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, weâ€™ll delve into the [Women's Ecommerce Clothing Reviews Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews), the dataset that helped us unlock valuable insights for ModaMetric. Your mission is to further refine the sentiment analysis process, enabling ModaMetric to better understand the sentiments embedded in the customer reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1: Orchestrating the Dance of Sentiment Analysis Models with Metaflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you'll utilize Metaflow to train two sentiment analysis models: the baseline \"majority class\" classifier and your own custom model. The models will be trained simultaneously, flexing the power of Metaflow. Your task also involves tweaking the models' hyperparameters for optimal performance. Finally, you'll analyze the performance of these models using Metaflow's Client API. Here's how you'll proceed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Constructing the Sentiment Analysis Workflows\n",
    "Your first task is to construct the Metaflow workflows. Begin with the baseline \"majority class\" classifier and then move on to your custom model. Make sure your custom model includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Feel free to use techniques from Week 1 and any other [resources](https://outerbounds.com/docs/nlp-tutorial-L2/) you find useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Parallel Training of Models\n",
    "Having built the models, you'll use Metaflow to train them simultaneously. The race is on - can the custom model outshine the baseline? If you find yourself in a bind, you might find the [FlowSpec branching documentation](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/basics#branch) useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: The Hyperparameters Experiment\n",
    "Once you've trained the models, it's time for some fine-tuning. Experiment with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. Record the performance of each model under different hyperparameter combinations as Data Artifacts in Metaflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Results Analysis\n",
    "With the experiments complete, it's time to analyze the results. Use Metaflow's Client API to fetch the data and create visualizations to compare the models' performances. The goal is to identify the best hyperparameters for each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this task, you're not only refining the sentiment analysis process at ModaMetric but also honing your own skills in orchestrating complex machine learning workflows using Metaflow.\n"

    "## Task 2: Mastering the Art of Anticipation: Failures and Remedies in ModaMetric's Machine Learning Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, your challenge is to step into the role of a foresightful data scientist at ModaMetric, where you'll be anticipating potential pitfalls in the sentiment analysis classifier project. Not just that, but you'll also be charting out strategies to steer clear of these hitches. Here's how you'll navigate through:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Forecasting Potential Failure Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to overcoming challenges is to anticipate them. Start by picturing possible failure scenarios from an engineering perspective. For instance, you might think about problems like overfitting to the training data or biases in the data. Remember, the first step to finding a solution is acknowledging the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overfitting to Training Data**: It's essential to be cautious of overfitting, where the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. To address this, we should explore techniques such as cross-validation and regularization methods to ensure our model's robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Biases**: We need to acknowledge the presence of biases in our data, as this can significantly impact the sentiment analysis results. Our strategies should include data preprocessing steps, like bias detection and correction, to ensure our model doesn't perpetuate any existing biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Quality Issues**: We should be prepared for data quality challenges, such as missing or noisy data. Robust data cleaning and preprocessing pipelines should be implemented to ensure our model works with high-quality data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: As the project progresses, scalability may become a concern. We should be proactive in selecting models and technologies that can handle increased data volume and computational demands as the project grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Strategizing to Mitigate Failure Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Having identified the potential obstacles, your next task is to devise counter-strategies. Consider what steps you'd take to address the problem if it arises. For instance, to counter overfitting, you could employ regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization. Think of this step as drawing up a contingency plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Counter Overfitting**: We'll employ regularization techniques, such as `L1` and `L2` regularization. Additionally, we'll implement techniques like early stopping during training to ensure our model doesn't become excessively complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Addressing Data Biases**: We'll establish a comprehensive bias detection and correction pipeline. This will involve methods to identify and rectify biases within the training data to ensure that our sentiment analysis classifier provides unbiased results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Quality Improvement**: We'll design robust data preprocessing pipelines, that will include data cleaning steps to deal with missing or noisy data, ensuring that our model operates with the highest data quality standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability Measures**: Distributed computing frameworks and efficient model architectures that can scale with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Planning Ahead to Dodge Failure Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond reactive strategies, you also need a proactive plan. What could you have done at the outset to avoid these potential pitfalls? Could you have collected a more diverse dataset to reduce bias? Or experimented with different model architectures? The goal is to minimize reactive measures and maximize foresight.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task emphasizes the importance of anticipation in machine learning projects. By identifying possible failure modes and crafting mitigation strategies, you'll be preparing yourself for a smooth-sailing machine learning journey at ModaMetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Diverse Data Collection**: To tackle biases head-on, we will make sure that our data collection process is as diverse as possible from the outset. This means actively seeking data from various sources, demographics, and regions. By collecting diverse data, we'll reduce the risk of model bias and ensure that our sentiment analysis classifier is inclusive and representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Architecture Experimentation**: We'll put an emphasis on experimenting with different model architectures early in the project. This experimentation allows us to find the most suitable architecture for our specific problem. By testing various models and architectures, we can select the one that shows the best performance and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Continuous Data Monitoring**: Data quality is paramount. To stay ahead of data quality issues, we'll implement continuous data monitoring. This involves setting up automated data quality checks and alerts that will notify us of any data quality problems in real-time. By proactively addressing data issues, we can maintain high-quality data throughout the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability from Day One**: From the project's inception, we will plan for scalability. We'll choose technologies and platforms that can easily scale with our data and user demands. This includes the deployment of cloud-based infrastructure and distributed systems to ensure that our project can handle growth effectively."

    "\n",
    "It's time for you to go beyond the code and transform data into a visual narrative. As a member of ModaMetric's data science team, your next mission is to enhance the existing flow in your `baseline_challenge.py` file. Add a new layer that gathers the results from all the hyperparameter tuning jobs. But that's not all - you're also going to breathe life into this aggregated data by creating a data visualization using Metaflow cards. Here's what you need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Extend Your Flow\n",

    "Your first challenge is to add another level to your existing `baseline_challenge.py` file. This new addition should be able to collate all the outcomes from your various hyperparameter tuning jobs. \n",

    "### Step 2: Log Results and Create Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've collected the outcomes, it's time to log the results in a structured way. Then, you're going to take this information and create a compelling data visualization using Metaflow cards. Remember, a picture is worth a thousand numbers. With these visual insights, you'll be enabling ModaMetric to understand the performance of your machine learning model in a glance.\n",
